# Video Player

This video player is generated by `Claude` by `Anthropic`.

It gave me a working version immediately. I went on and asked claude a few more iterations to make the output a little more perfect. Finally, I've adjusted a few things for my requirements. That's not even a 5% effort.

Without claude I don't know how much it will take to buid this simple player.
